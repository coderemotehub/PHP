# PHP Learning Repository

This repository is designed to help you learn PHP from the basics all the way up to using it with Symfony framework. It follows an interactive "learn by doing" approach, allowing you to practice your PHP skills through hands-on exercises and projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Follow the instructions provided in each module to learn and practice PHP concepts.
4. As you progress, you will also learn how to integrate PHP with Symfony framework.

## Docker

For each module, we will use a Dockerfile to take advantage of learning Docker. The Dockerfile will provide an isolated environment for running and testing your PHP code. Instructions on how to use the Dockerfile will be provided in each module.

### What is Docker? 
 * Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. 
 * Containers are lightweight, isolated environments that package everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries.
 * Docker provides a consistent and reproducible environment for running applications, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy software across different environments.
For more information, you can refer to the official Docker documentation: [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/)
